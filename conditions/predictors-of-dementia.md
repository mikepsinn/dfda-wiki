## Drugs

A 2019 study conducted in England included 284,343 patients. It looked at 56 different anticholinergic drugs to see their effects on risk for dementia. The study found that people had a higher risk for dementia if they took:

-   Antidepressants,
-   Antiparkinson drugs,
-   Antipsychotics,
-   Antimuscarinics (Used to treat an overactive bladder), and
-   Antiepileptic drugs.

The study also found that the below-listed drugs did not increase the risk of developing dementia:

-   Antihistamines (Used to treat allergy symptoms),
-   Gastrointestinal antispasmodics (Used to prevent spasms of the stomach, bladder, and intestines),
-   Skeletal Muscle Relaxants (Used to relax and reduce tension in muscles, such as muscle spasms or hyperreflexia),
-   Antimuscarinic bronchodilators (Used to relax the muscles in the lungs, allowing breathing to come easier), and
-   Antiarrhythmics (Used to treat heart rhythm disorders).

### Anticholinergics

[Anticholinergics](https://www.healthline.com/health/anticholinergics#drug-list) are drugs that block the action of acetylcholine. Anticholinergics can treat a variety of conditions, including:

-   urinary incontinence
-   overactive bladder (OAB)
-   chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
-   certain types of poisoning

From the study, [Cumulative Use of Strong Anticholinergics and Incident Dementia](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091745):

> Likelihood of dementia based on doses of Anticholinergics over the previous 10 years:
> 
> -   1 to 90 doses - 0.92 times more likely
> -   91 to 365 doses - 1.19 times more likely
> -   366 to 1095 doses - 1.23 times more likely
> -   \>1095 doses - 1.54 times more likely

### Antidepressants

Patients with depression are associated with a higher risk of dementia, and the use of antidepressants is not shown to be a protective factor against dementia. Further large-scale trials are required for the investigation of the benefit-risk ratio between depression relapse and dementia when prescribing antidepressants.

#### Antidepressants Overall

From [Depression and Antidepressants as Potential Risk Factors in Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 18 Longitudinal Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30711460/):

-   Depressed who used antidepressants - 1.50 times more likely to get dementia
-   Depressed who did not use antidepressants - 1.31 times more likely to get dementia

Although people who use antidepressants are more likely to get dementia, the more severe the depression, the more likely they are to use antidepressants. Thus, the increased risk of dementia may actually be a result of the biological processes causing their increased depression severity, not antidepressant use.

#### Classes of Antidepressants

From [Increased Risk of Dementia in Patients with Antidepressants: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bn/2018/5315098/):

-   SSRIs: [1.75](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bn/2018/5315098/) relative risk (RR) (95% CI: 1.033â€“2.964)
-   Tricyclic: [2.131](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bn/2018/5315098/) relative risk (RR) (95% CI: 1.427â€“3.184)
-   MAOIs: [2.791](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bn/2018/5315098/) relative risk (RR) (95% CI: 1.086â€“7.169)

[MAOIs](../reference-databases/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois.md) are only prescribed to the most severely depressed patients. So, although people who use [MAOIs](../reference-databases/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois.md) are more likely to get dementia, the more severe the depression, the more likely they are to use [MAOIs](../reference-databases/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois.md). Thus, the increased risk of dementia may actually be a result of the biological processes causing their increased depression severity, not [MAOI](../reference-databases/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois.md) use. Indeed, Alzheimer's disease is associated with [elevated levels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0306452294903115?via%3Dihub) of [MAO-B](../reference-databases/mao-b.md) in the brain.
