# Tests to Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease

Certain gene mutations can indicate a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.

## Early Onset Alzheimer's Gene Mutations

Early Onset Alzheimer's makes up 10% of all people with Alzheimer's disease.

The three single-gene mutations associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease are:

-   Amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21
-   Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14
-   Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1

People with down syndrome carry a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's because they are born with an extra chromosome with carries the APP gene mutation.

There is no blood test that can predict 100% if a person gets Alzheimer's rather one that shows your risk of developing it.

## Normal Alzheimer's Gene Mutations

-   Having a genetic variant of the apolipoprotein E _(APOE)_ gene on chromosome 19 does increase a person's risk
-   APOE4 [increases](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet) risk for Alzheimer's disease

No blood tests can currently diagnose Alzheimer's before symptoms develop but other tests are currently in development. [https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/blood-tests-show-promise-early-alzheimers-diagnosis](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/blood-tests-show-promise-early-alzheimers-diagnosis)
