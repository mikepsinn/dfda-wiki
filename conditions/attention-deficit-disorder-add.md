# Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)

**ADD** is the term commonly used to describe symptoms of inattention, distractibility, and poor working memory. ADHD is the term used to describe additional symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity. Both are included in the medical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

## Stimulants

### Mechanism of Action

The cognitive-enhancing effects of stimulants are due to the preferential effect of catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and activation of the norepinephrine and dopamine D1 receptors. Catecholamines are a group of neurotransmitters including norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), and [dopamine (DA)](../reference/dopaminergic-repair-stack.md). At low doses that a doctor may prescribe, the PFC-dependent function is enhanced, which contributes to the stimulants' use in ADHD. At larger doses, the PFC-dependent attention processes are improved at the expense of other processes, like working memory or response inhibition.

Methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine ([Adderall](../interventions/adderall.md)) both increase extracellular levels of NE and DA throughout the brain, largely by blocking NE and DA reuptake. Amphetamine additionally stimulates the release of DA through the DA transporter. And while amphetamines at higher doses block serotonin reuptake, methylphenidate only blocks NE and DA reuptake.

### Outcomes

The two Mayo Clinic studies are the first population-based, long-term studies to investigate links between ADHD, school performance, and factors that modify the long-term school performance of children with ADHD. Researchers followed the children from the time they were born for, on average, 18 years. Of the more than 5,000 children evaluated, 370 (277 boys and 93 girls) were identified as having ADHD. Researchers matched them by age and gender to 740 children who did not meet the research criteria for having AD/HD. In addition to medical stimulants such as methylphenidate, also called Ritalin, the study examined the effects on school outcomes of maternal age, socioeconomic background, and special education services the students received.

The children treated with stimulants typically began taking medication in elementary school and received it for nearly three years -- on average, for 30.4 months.

#### Gender

Girls and boys with untreated ADHD were equally vulnerable to poor school outcomes -- and girls may be at risk of being under-identified as having ADHD, and therefore under-treated.

#### Reading

By age 13, on average, the stimulant dose was modestly correlated with improved reading achievement scores.

#### Absenteeism

Both treatments with stimulants and a longer duration of medication were associated with decreased absenteeism.

#### Grade Retention

Children with A/HD who were treated with stimulants were 1.8 times less likely to be retained a grade than children with ADHD who were not treated.

#### Educational and Behavioral Outcomes for Children with ADHD

-   The use of stimulants increased without improving medium or long-term outcomes.
-   There was no medium or long-term improvement even in children with the worst pre-existing ADHD symptoms.
-   Increases in drug use were associated with increases in depression among girls.

At the end of the 14-month study, the stimulant group showed significantly greater improvements in ADHD symptoms than the control groups. However, 3, 6, and 8 years later, there were no longer significant treatment group differences in ADHD symptoms or functioning.
