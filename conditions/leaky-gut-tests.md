# Leaky Gut Tests

Gluten can cause silent inflammation in the gut, which can eventually lead to intestinal permeability or “leaky gut.”

NSAID medications, chronic stress, excess alcohol, proton pump inhibitors, and other factors can also contribute to “leaky gut,” which allows undigested food particles, bacteria, and other antigens to escape into the bloodstream where they can trigger allergies, sensitivities, and inflammation in various parts of the body. This Gut Permeability test helps to determine if leaky gut is present and can be used to monitor the complete healing of the gut lining.
