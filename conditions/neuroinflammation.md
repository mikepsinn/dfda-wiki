# Neuroinflammation

Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory response within the brain or spinal cord.

## Depression

Depressed patients present increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and neuroinflammatory alterations.

Male rats received amitriptyline (AMI) a tricyclic, S-citalopram (ESC) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP) a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, vortioxetine (VORT) a multimodal AD or saline for ten days.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [induces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032719326539) despair-like, impaired motivation/self-care behavior, and caused [anhedonia](./anhedonia.md).

All ADs prevented LPS-induced despair-like behavior.

Only VORT rescued impaired self-care behavior.

All ADs prevented LPS-induced increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines \[interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6\] and T-helper 1 cytokines \[tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interferon-Î³\].

VORT increased striatal and hypothalamic IL-4 levels.

All ADs prevented LPS-induced neuroendocrine alterations, represented by increased levels of hypothalamic nitrite and plasma corticosterone response.

VORT and ESC prevented LPS-induced increase in NF-kBp65 hippocampal expression.

ESC, TCP, and VORT, but not IMI, prevented the alterations in phospho-CREB expression.

## MAOIs

Inflammation is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are expressed by immune and non-immune cells. Their dysregulation is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Significant evidence supports that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. MAO inhibitors are principally prescribed for the management of a variety of central nervous system (CNS)-associated diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's; however, they also have anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS and a variety of non-CNS tissues. To bolster support for their development as anti-inflammatories, it is critical to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action.

MAO inhibitors decrease the generation of end products such as:

-   hydrogen peroxide
-   aldehyde
-   ammonium

They also inhibit biogenic amine degradation, and this increases cellular and pericellular catecholamines in a variety of immune and some non-immune cells. This decrease in end product metabolites and increase in catecholamines can play a significant role in the anti-inflammatory effects of MAO inhibitors.

Irreversible and reversible [MAO-A](../reference-databases/mao-a.md), [MAO-B](../reference-databases/mao-b.md), and MAO-A/B inhibitors have all been shown to significantly reduce inflammation-associated cytokine and chemokine gene and protein expression in a variety of cell cultures and animal studies.
