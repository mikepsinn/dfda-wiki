# Diseases Associated with Intestinal Permeability

A critical function of the intestinal mucosa, particularly the epithelium, is to form a barrier that prevents potentially noxious contents of the intestinal lumen, including the microbiota, from accessing internal sites and systemic circulation. Barrier defects have been reliably associated with a variety of human diseases, including those primarily affecting the gut, e.g.

-   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
-   Celiac disease,
-   Irritable bowel syndrome

As well as systemic diseases or diseases involving other organ systems, e.g.

-   Type I diabetes
-   Graft versus host disease (GVHD)
-   HIV
-   Multiple sclerosis
-   Rheumatoid arthritis
-   Autism

The topic is further confused by the use of the term 'leaky gut syndrome' within the lay and alternative medicine communities, and even by some physicians, and claims that this is responsible for a dizzying array of disorders, including

-   Chronic fatigue syndrome
-   Fibromyalgia
-   Allergies
-   Depression
-   Skin disorders

## Alzheimer's

In humans, intestinal permeability increases with age43, and elderly individuals show an association between increased LPS-binding protein (a marker of microbial translocation) and inflammation. Moreover, a recent study involving postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD showed that LPS and gram-negative _E_. _coli_ fragments co-localize with amyloid plaques. Thus, an increased abundance of gram-negative intestinal bacteria such as _Bacteroides_ in participants with AD may result in increased translocation of LPS from the gut to the systemic circulation, which in turn may contribute to or exacerbate AD pathology through inflammation or other mechanisms.

Additionally, compared to control participants, AD participants in our study exhibited decreased Actinobacteria. These differences were mostly driven by changes in _Bifidobacterium_. Actinobacteria, particularly members of the _Bifidobacterium_ genus, are important bacterial inhabitants of the human gut throughout the lifespan, and their beneficial health effects have been well-documented. In particular, certain species of _Bifidobacterium_ are associated with anti-inflammatory properties and decreased intestinal permeability.
