# Dementia Society of America

[https://www.dementiasociety.org](https://www.dementiasociety.org/about)

The Dementia Society of America brings much-needed education, local resources, and life-enrichment to individuals and families impacted by Dementia.

We recognize dementia caregivers and innovators and raise hope by spotlighting relevant research to discover cures, causes, encourage early detection and meaningful interventions.

## Goal

1.  How long have you been working with the Dementia Society of America?
2.  When was DSA founded?
3.  How has dementia affected you personally? Do you have a loved one that suffers from dementia? How would you describe your organization's most wildly important goal?
4.  How do you measure your progress towards this goal? Is there an easy way to measure cognitive performance over time?
5.  Do you work with [Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/cognitive-vitality) ? If so, what do you work on with them?
6.  Say you have a family member suffering with dementia. How would you go about fixing dat?
7.  Do you commonly observe cognitive variations over time with people with dementia? Are different types of dementia more likely to be variable in this way?
8.  Are you aware of any programs, organizations, or apps that can be used by caregivers to track cognitive performance/diet/treatments and analyzes to identify the effects of different factors?
9.  If you look at hospital records from 1990-2010, deaths attributed to Alzheimer's Disease [tripled](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/open-epidemiology/) Do you believe that there has an increase in diagnostic changes or an increase in prevalence since 1990?
