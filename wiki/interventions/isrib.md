_**What is ISR and why would the researchers be inhibiting it?**_

The integrated stress response (or ISR) is a signaling pathway that is present in eukaryotic cells (cells that have a nucleus). It is activated in response to a selection of internal or external factors.

The external conditions can include nutrient deprivation and viral infection, while internal factors largely focus on _endoplasmic reticulum stress_ as a result of the accumulation of unfolded proteins.

_**What is endoplasmic reticulum stress?**_

The endoplasmic reticulum (or ER) is a highly convoluted, net-like mesh structure that extends off the nucleus. It is the assembly line where proteins are produced within a cell.

The nucleus is where the blueprints for making and maintaining an organism are kept in the form of DNA. A template of how to produce a particular protein can be generated from this DNA and that template is called messenger RNA (or simply _mRNA_).

mRNA is used to produce a protein (via a process called _translation_). A large part of that protein production process is conducted within the endoplasmic reticulum – proteins are produced and start to be folded into their correct confirmation. In times of cellular stress, however, unfolded proteins can start to pile up in the ER and this causes ER stress.

_**Ok, got it. So ER stress can initiate the integrated stress response?**_

Yes, it is one of the internal factors involved in initiating the ISR.

The internal or external factors activate four ISR regulators: the stress-responsive protein kinases PERK, PKR, HRI, and GCN2.

_**What is a kinase?**_ 

A kinase is an enzyme – a biological catalyst; a protein that facilitates specific chemical reactions in cells. In particular, kinases catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from phosphate-donating molecules to specific recipients.

_**What’s a phosphate group?**_

A phosphate group is characterized by a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. They are important in activating proteins so that the proteins can perform particular functions in cells.

_**Ok, so what do the four ISR regulator kinases activate?**_

All four of the ISR regulator kinases converge on the core of the ISR: a protein called _eIF2α._

_**What is eIF2α?**_

Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 alpha (or eIF2α) plays a central role in protein synthesis. Specifically, it is involved in the early steps of that process.

But during periods of cellular stress, eIF2α is targeted by the stress-responsive protein kinases. These proteins phosphorylate eIF2α which inhibits its ability of it to do its function, causing a reduction in global protein production.

_**Wait – what does phos…phory…late mean?**_

Phosphorylation of a protein is basically the process of turning it on or off – making it useful or inactivating it. From allowing a protein to fold in a particular manner to actually activating/deactivating the function of a protein, phosphorylation is a critical function in cellular biology.

_Phosphorylation of a kinase protein. Source:_ [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/the-phosphorylation-of-a-protein-can-make-14747879)

Phosphorylation occurs via the addition or removal of phosphates. Their addition or removal determines the state of the protein is phosphorylated.

Phosphorylation of eIF2α by the stress-responsive protein kinases inactivates/inhibits it.

This inactivation results in a reduction of protein synthesis, but there is an increase in the translation of a certain number of RNAs that are not affected by eIF2α phosphorylation. One of these gives rise to a protein called _ATF4_.

_**And what is ATF4?**_

Activating transcription factor 4 (or ATF4) is a protein whose activity is associated with its cellular localization. For example, under situations involving ER stress, ATF4 migrates to the nucleus, where it activates genes involved in many cellular pathways focused on restoring normality (or _homeostasis_) in cells.

![](https://scienceofpd.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/fncel-11-00410-g001-e1618082005622.jpg?w=656&h=437)

_Source:_ [_Frontiers_](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2017.00410/full)

Problems start to arise, however, in periods of prolonged (pathological) ER stress. During such times, ATF4 can shift away from activating survival-oriented pathways in neuronal cells to activating pro-cell death (_apoptosis_) pathways.

Thus, chronic ER stress is not a good thing. And there is evidence that prolonged ER stress may occur in neurodegenerative conditions associated with misfolded protein – like some cases of Parkinson’s.

**RECAP #1:**  The integrated stress response (or ISR) is a signaling pathway that is activated in cells during times of stress. It results in the inactivation of a protein called eIF2α, which results in a reduction in protein production in the cell.  
 

During episodes of mild cellular stress, this inactivation can give the cell an opportunity to recover, but during sustained ISR activation, the consequences can be negative (resulting in cell death).

_**So what did the researchers investigate in their research report?**_

The investigators involved in the study had previously presented the discovery of a molecule that could inhibit the integrated stress response.

They called the molecule _ISRIB_ (or ISR InhiBitor).

This is the report about the discovery:

**Title:** Pharmacological brake-release of mRNA translation enhances cognitive memory  
**Authors:** Sidrauski C, Acosta-Alvear D, Khoutorsky A, Vedantham P, Hearn BR, Li H, Gamache K, Gallagher CM, Ang KK, Wilson C, Okreglak V, Ashkenazi A, Hann B, Nader K, Arkin MR, Renslo AR, Sonenberg N, Walter P.  
**Journal:** Elife. 2013 May 28;2:e00498.  
**PMID:** [**23741617**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23741617/)          (This report is [**OPEN ACCESS**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667625/) if you would like to read it)

In this study, the researchers conducted a drug screening experiment that involved evaluating 106,281 compounds for their ability to inhibit the PERK kinase. From that investigation, they identified a molecule that acted downstream of all four of the ISR protein kinases. That molecule potently (IC50 = 5 nM) reversed the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation.

This was the molecule that they called ISRIB.

Alone, ISRIB would represent an extremely useful investigational tool, but when the researchers injected it into mice, they found a really interesting result: _the molecule improved memory_.

The investigators trained mice to find a hidden platform in a swimming-based memory test (called the Morris Water Maze). The water is made opaque and during the first training session (“1st trial” in the image below) the mice explore all areas of the pool. After a number of training sessions, the mice remember where the platform is and make a more direct path to it (see the “8th trial” image below).

The researchers reduced the number of training sessions in this study and found that mice injected with ISRIB were able to locate the hidden platform in the water maze more rapidly than control injected animals (displaying less latency in finding the platform):

_Source:_ [_PMC_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667625/)

The researchers also reported that ISRIB improved performance in fear conditioning memory tests. These results indicated to the scientists that eIF2α phosphorylation has an important role in “_modulating higher-order brain function_“.

These interesting results were replicated and then further explored in a follow-up study, which was published in 2017:

**Title:** Inhibition of the integrated stress response reverses cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury.  
**Authors:** Chou A, Krukowski K, Jopson T, Zhu PJ, Costa-Mattioli M, Walter P, Rosi S.  
**Journal:** Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Aug 1;114(31): E6420-E6426.  
**PMID:** [**28696288**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28696288/)                 (This report is [**OPEN ACCESS**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5547647/) if you would like to read it)

In this study, the researchers reported that ISRIB rescued the cognitive ability of mice in two models of traumatic brain injury. Remarkably, this protective effect occurred even when ISRIB was “_administered weeks after the initial injury and maintained cognitive improvement after treatment was terminated_“.

The researchers concluded that their results “_indicate that ISR inhibition at time points late after_ an _injury can reverse memory deficits associated with traumatic brain injury”._

For those interested, the exact mechanism of action for ISRIB has been explored in depth. Un-phosphorylated eIF2α binds with two other proteins, eIEF2β and eIF2γ, and collectively they initiate translation. Once phosphorylated, eIF2α limits the ability of this collection of subunits to do their function, grinding protein synthesis to a halt.

Mutation analysis has demonstrated that ISRIB binds to eIF2β, where it stabilizes that protein and stimulates its activity independently of eIF2α phosphorylation. This action favors the restoration of translational activity ([**Click here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837216/) and [**here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4538794/) to read more about this).

_**Interesting. Has ISRIB been tested in models of neurodegenerative conditions?**_

Yes, it has.

Recently ISRIB administration was evaluated in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s and the results indicate a beneficial effect:

**Title:** Correction of eIF2-dependent defects in brain protein synthesis, synaptic plasticity, and memory in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.  
**Authors:** Oliveira MM, Lourenco MV, Longo F, Kasica NP, Yang W, Ureta G, Ferreira DDP, Mendonça PHJ, Bernales S, Ma T, De Felice FG, Klann E, Ferreira ST.  
**Journal:** Sci Signal. 2021 Feb 2;14(668):eabc5429.  
**PMID:** [**33531382**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33531382/)                  (A [**preprint manuscript**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.344564v1) of this report is openly available)

In this report, the researchers evaluated ISR inhibition in multiple models of Alzheimer’s and found that it improved performance on memory-associated behavior tests. They also reported that postmortem brain tissue from people who passed away with Alzheimer’s showed increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (compared to unaffected control cases).

It should be noted, however, that this result stands in contrast to two previous studies that found no beneficial effect from ISRIB ([**Click here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075699/) and [**here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5510086/) to read those reports). But the researchers in this new study note a significant difference in the dosing used between the studies: this new study found that low dose ISRIB (0.25 mg/kg) for several days had beneficial effects in the Alzheimer’s mouse model, while not having any noticeable effect in normal control mice. The previous studies used much higher doses (2.5-5 mg/kg).

Researchers have also published research suggesting that ISRIB treatment could have potential applications in motor neuron disease ([**Click here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250913/) to read more about this).

_**Could ISRIB have an effect on age-associate memory issues?**_

So this is the trillion dollar question – could ISRIB help everyone as we age?

As we get older, there is a significant decline in protein synthesis in the brain. It has been proposed at this reduction correlates with defects in proper protein folding ([**Click here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/) to read more about this). Inappropriate protein folding is believed to put pressure on the ER, which may result in a gradual increase in ER stress and activation of the ISR.

Recently researchers have looked at the question of whether ISRIB treatment could have any effect on age-associate cognitive issues. They reported their results in December 2020 – which brings us back to the report mentioned at the top of this post:

![](https://scienceofpd.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/isrib2-e1614775339414.jpg?w=656&h=312)

**Title:** Small molecule cognitive enhancer reverses age-related memory decline in mice.  
**Authors:** Krukowski K, Nolan A, Frias ES, Boone M, Ureta G, Grue K, Paladini MS, Elizarraras E, Delgado L, Bernales S, Walter P, Rosi S.  
**Journal:** Elife. 2020 Dec 1;9:e62048.  
**PMID:** [**33258451**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258451/)                  (This report is [**OPEN ACCESS**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721440/) if you would like to read it)

In this study, the researchers firstly started by looking at ATF4 levels in the brains of young and old mice. You will recall that we discussed activating transcription factor 4 (or ATF4) above – it is one of the RNAs that are not affected by eIF2α phosphorylation. The investigators looked at ATF4 levels in the brains of young and old mice, and they found that it was significantly higher in the older mice:

_Source:_ [_PMC_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721440/)

When the researchers treated old mice with ISRIB, ATF4 levels returned to the levels closer to those seen in young mice (see graph above).

Interestingly, these ATF4 levels correlated with the number of errors  in spatial and working memory tests – older mice made more mistakes – but when the researchers treated the older mice with ISRIB, the mice made fewer mistakes:

![](https://scienceofpd.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/errors-e1617749103356.png?w=656)

_Source:_ [_PMC_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721440/)

The investigators also looked at changes in brain activity that were associated with the ISRIB treatment and found that a single injection of ISRIB the day before testing could reverse certain age-associated changes in neuronal activity.

The researchers concluded that temporary treatment with ISRIB could lead to long-lasting reductions of ATF4 (up to 20 days post-treatment). This ‘ISR reset’ was associated with improvements in spatial and working memory and neuronal activity. They suggest that their data indicate that pharmacological attenuation of the ISR could relieve age-related neuronal changes “_potentially resetting age-induced cognitive decline_“.

**\# #**  
 

**RECAP #2:** Numerous reports have indicated that a molecule called ISRIB (or ISR InhiBitor) is able to rescue the ISR response and restore protein production in the cell.  
 

This action has been reported to have beneficial effects in models of both neurodegenerative conditions and age-associated cognitive issues.

_**Has anyone conducted a clinical trial of ISRIB?**_

Not yet. But it will not be too far away.

In small print at the bottom of some of the reports discussed in this post, it has been stated that the rights to ISRIB have been licensed by UCSF (the research institute that discovered the molecule) to a biotech company called [**Calico**](https://www.calicolabs.com/)**.**
