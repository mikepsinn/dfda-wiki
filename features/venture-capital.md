# Terminology

### Investment Multiple 

The investment multiple is also known as the total value to paid-in (TVPI) multiple. It is calculated by dividing the fund's cumulative distributions and residual value by the paid-in capital. It provides insight into the fund's performance by showing the fund's total value as a multiple of its cost basis. Furthermore, it does not take into account the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/082703.asp).
