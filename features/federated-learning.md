-   Open-Mind
-   Federated learning (also known as collaborative learning) is a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29) holding local [data samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), without exchanging them. This approach stands in contrast to traditional centralized machine learning techniques where all the local datasets are uploaded to one [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29), as well as to more classical decentralized approaches which often assume that local data samples are [identically distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables).
