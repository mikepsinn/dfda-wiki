# Antidepressant Reviews

The largest databases of aggregate patient reviews of medications are [Drugs.com](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx?show=drugs), [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx?show=drugs), and [AskAPatient](https://www.askapatient.com/). Correlations between Drugs.com, AskAPatient, and WebMD were generally large and positive ([around 0.7](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/30/prescriptions-paradoxes-and-perversities/)).

## Compared to Doctor Reviews

Surprisingly, in general, the more patients like an antidepressant, the lower doctors rate it and the less likely it is to be prescribed. RateRx solicits ratings from doctors, not patients.

Doctor reviews on RateRx [correlated at -0.21](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/30/prescriptions-paradoxes-and-perversities/) with patient reviews. The negative relationship is nonsignificant, but that just means that at best, doctor reviews are totally uncorrelated with patient consensus.
