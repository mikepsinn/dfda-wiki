### Connectivity

Using a Representational State Transfer (REST) connection, API data is returned in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. There are two connectivity options for API:

1.  **Link API:** Connect to us directly through a secure connection for all available API types.
2.  **API Extended X12:** API data is returned as an extension to EDI transaction responses. Currently available for claim status only, but eligibility and benefits will be available soon.
