# Zonulin

Zonulin is the only human protein known to reversibly regulate intestinal permeability.

Two key triggers that augment zonulin expression, with implications for the development of numerous autoimmune conditions, including celiac disease (CD) and type 1 diabetes. These triggers are gluten and gut bacteria.

Gliadin from gluten causes zonulin levels to increase, both in those people who have CD and those who do not. Changes in gut microbiota have also been observed to trigger the zonulin pathway leading to a loss of intestinal barrier function. This results in the passage of harmful molecules into the bloodstream and the activation of inflammatory and autoimmune processes. It is also conceivable that zonulin participates in the physiological regulation of intercellular TJs of the vascular endothelium, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with wide implications for mood and cognition.

## Alzheimer's Disease

Higher zonulin levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease. This could be due to zonulin's ability to increase permeability of the blood brain barrier. This allows passage of bacteria and garbage proteins into the brain.
