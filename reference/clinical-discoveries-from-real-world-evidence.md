# Clinical Discoveries from Real World Evidence

## Deep learning framework for drug repurposing via emulating clinical trials using real-world patient data

There's evidence that the analysis of aggregate observational data can produce tremendous value. 

By analyzing insurance claims from over 100 million people, this recurrent neural network (RNN) discovered that at least 6 drugs were effective at treating coronary artery disease:
