# Curobot

![Reminder Inbox Screenshot.jpg](https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/img/630px-Reminder_Inbox_Screenshot.jpg)

The Curobot app collects and aggregates data on symptoms, diet, sleep, exercise, weather, medication, and anything else from dozens of life-tracking apps and devices. Then, it analyzes this data to reveal hidden factors exacerbating or improving symptoms of chronic illness:

-   Fitbit â€“ Sleep Duration, Sleep Quality, Steps, Physical Activity
-   Withings â€“ [Blood Pressure](../reference-databases/blood-pressure.md), Weight, Environmental CO2 Levels, Ambient Temperature
-   Weather â€“ Local Humidity, Cloud Cover, Temperature
-   Facebook â€“ Social Interaction, Likes
-   Github â€“ Code Commits
-   MyFitnessPal â€“ Food and Nutrient Intake
-   MoodPanda â€“ Basic Reported Mood
-   MoodScope â€“ Detailed Reported Mood Using Panas
-   Sleep as Android â€“ Snoring, Deep Sleep, Reported Sleep Rating

### Data Analysis

![Machine Learning.png](https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/img/688px-Machine_Learning.png)

The Crowdsourcing Cures Analytics Engine mines data using powerful, proprietary algorithms which perform temporal precedence accounting, longitudinal data aggregation, erroneous data filtering, unit conversions, ingredient tagging, and variable grouping to quantify correlations between symptoms, treatments, and other factors.

It then pairs every combination of variables and identifies likely causal relationships using correlation mining algorithms in conjunction with a pharmacokinetic model.  The algorithms first identify the onset delay and duration of action for each hypothetical cause. It then identifies the optimal daily values for each factor.

## The Vision

With the advent of mobile technologies we are all producing tremendous amounts of 'digital exhaust'.  Any time we change our diet, environment, medication, exercise routine, or anything else in our daily routine we are creating a 'natural experiment'.  Throughout history, man has been swimming in an ocean of naturally generated data but it has never been possible to capture and use it.  Whereas the invention of the internal combustion engine finally allowed us to exploit fossil fuels to raise the universal standard of living, new mobile technologies are allowing us to finally exploit naturally generated data to improve human existence.  There are applications and devices that allow us to effortlessly track sleep, diet, exercise, medications, symptoms, mood, environmental factors and just about anything else.

We now have the opportunity to use machine learning to solve problems that have been plaguing mankind throughout history. Our children will look back on the current era as a Dark Age where millions of people suffered needlessly because health decisions were a product of intuition and data from the mind of a single physician.  

The rules of living 'the Good Life', for thousands of years left to the speculation of philosophers, can now be derived as personal mathematical equations for the personal health and happiness of every individual. With this platform, we plan to give birth to a new quantitative scientific discipline of quantitative life optimization.
