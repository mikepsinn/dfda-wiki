# Joe Cohen

So Joe Cohen had some genetic bad luck and suffered from inflammation, brain fog, fatigue, digestive problems, anxiety, depression, and other health issues.

Instead of curling up in a fetal ball and crying (which is my go-to technique for addressing any challenges in life), he spent 17 years reading over 30,000 PubMed articles and engaging in self-experimentation until he'd found a regimen that allowed him to rise like a phoenix bootstrapping 3 successful and profitable companies with almost no external investment, SelfHacked, SelfDecode and LabTestAnalyzer.

His mission is to help people gain access to the most up-to-date, unbiased, and science-based ways to optimize their health.

He's given consultations to over 1000 people who have sought his health advice. He's written hundreds of science posts, and multiple books on improving health, and speaks at various health conferences.

He's building a team of top scientists who will improve the level of accuracy of health content on the web. Furthermore, he also founded SelfDecode and LabTestAnalyzer, popular genetic and lab software tools to improve health.

## Genius Labs

Genius Labs is the parent company of SelfHacked, SelfDecode and Lab Test Analyzer. The company also offers licensing and development services for organizations and professionals looking to create their own health & science apps of the highest caliber.

## SelfDecode

[https://selfdecode.com/](https://selfdecode.com/)

SelfDecode is a personalized health report service, which enables users to obtain detailed information and reports based on their genome.

## SelfHacked

[https://selfhacked.com/](https://selfhacked.com/)

With SelfHacked, Joe and his army of geniuses are basically synthesizing and condensing all available technical research papers to make them consumable and useful to the average biologically screwed-up humanoid. SelfHacked now gets millions of monthly readers.

## Lab Test Analyzer

## Questions

1.  So you seem to accomplish far more than mortal men. You've read over 30k PubMed articles, have done thousands of self-experiments, and built two very successful companies. Are you some sort of superhuman, or do you have a secret twin, and you're both pretending to be the same person (Ã  la various sitcom plots)?
2.  What is the most effective intervention you've ever used to enhance your cognitive function?
3.  What's the most cost-effective intervention?
4.  What is the most effective intervention you've ever used to improve your mood?
5.  What is the most cost-effective intervention?
6.  Would you agree that the lowest hanging fruit in terms of eradicating dementia and mental illnesses is aggregating all the silos of data in the world, analyzing it, and stratifying it to create personalized [outcome labels](../features/outcome-labels-plugin.md)?
7.  Describe the world you hope to see before your untimely demise.
8.  Do you have a detailed strategic plan for realizing this world?
9.  Are you seeking any government grants to accelerate SelfDecode or Lab Test Analyzer?
10.  So with SelfHacked, SelfDecode, and LabTestAnalyzer, you are curating and helping individuals apply the vast amount of existing research on the effectiveness of various treatments for individuals with specific genetic mutations. What is the largest bottleneck to medical progress and reducing suffering? Lack of public resource allocation? Lack of open source access to publicly funded software?
11.  Do you think that with new gene editing technologies like CRISPR Cas9, we'll one day be able to design our babies to come with cool accessories like cup holders and built-in CD players?
12.  If you had a magic wand and could combine all existing data on symptom severity (from electronic health records, digital health apps, and devices, Google search histories, etc.) with all the existing data on factors that could influence symptom severity (Instacart and food delivery purchase data, Walgreens prescription purchase data, Amazon supplement purchase data, gene sequences) in a global anonymous database. Do you think that we could treat the human body as a black box and use machine learning tools such as convolutional neural networks to determine the optimal inputs (foods/supplements/drugs) to produce the optimal outputs (minimize symptom severity)? If so, is the pursuit of research to gain a full understanding of the internal mechanisms of action relatively inefficient compared to the black box input/output approach?

## Wellness Focus Vs. Alleviating Disease

In order to avoid the innovation-crushing burden of FDA scrutiny, you've stated that Genius Labs is focused on "wellness" and not alleviating disease. What are the practical limitations and differences of a wellness focus? Or is it simply required to say this for compliance purposes?

## Limiting Factor for Progress

Is the value that Genius Labs can provide currently limited by the amount of available published research? Has all available formal research been maximally leveraged? Could your goal be more effectively achieved by combining and analyzing all existing treatment and outcome data?

## Proprietary Model vs. Open Source Model

In your campaign investor panel video, you focus on and highlight the intellectual property that Genius Labs owns and is continuing to develop. This relatively closed and proprietary model for innovation is currently nearly universal within the digital health industry. My question is, is the model optimal or required for innovation, or is it possible that a more open source and collaborative model such as WordPress could produce more value faster for everyone by eliminating the duplication of programmer effort that occurs when multiple companies are building the exact same features? Despite being open source, WordPress has a $3 billion valuation. This value is derived from the services it provides, which themselves are made more valuable by the free and open source contributions of the developer ecosystem. So it's able to transcend the zero-sum game of winners and losers, allowing everyone to be a winner by participating. If you don't think an open source is an optimal or desirable path in the private digital health sector, do you believe that publicly-funded projects like All of Us at the NIH should be required to open source their code?

## New Discoveries vs. Interpretation of Results Based on Existing Data

So far, it seems you have been exclusively focused on making test results more useful to individuals by finding the most relevant and useful needles for an individual in the enormous haystack of all medical research. Do you plan to expand your scope to making and publishing new discoveries based on the data that you've collected, or stick to the interpretation of DNA sequences and lab results?

## Investment Opportunity

With pretty much every force in the universe working against the financial success of a new startup, Joe's phenomenal success at profit generation almost seems magical. You, the listeners, currently have a unique opportunity to share in this success at [https://wefunder.com/selfdecode](https://wefunder.com/selfdecode). So, say someone goes there and gives $100K, I assume you'd receive about 0.3% ownership stakes, based on your current valuation of $35M. So if you sold the company to 23andMe in 10 years, for $350M, the investor would receive a 10x return on their investment. I assume there would be no dividends paid to the investor prior to the exit, is that correct? Would it be legally possible for the investors' 0.3% to be diluted in a future round? What would the investor receive if you never exit?

## Partnerships

Based on your pitch deck and ambitions stated on your fundraising page, it seems like you want to do everything. Microbiome analysis, genes, sell supplements, decision support for doctors, treatment outcome data collection, lab result analysis. Normally, I would write someone off as ambitious to the point of insanity (like myself) for putting so much on their plate. However, your amazing track record so far, makes me think you could actually pull this off. And your unique value proposition as a holistic integration of all facets of the human is essential to realizing the potential of the preventative personalized medicine of the future. However, on the competitor page of your pitch deck, I do get the feeling you're eating everyone else's lunch and becoming the whole ecosystem instead of integrating and becoming simply filling a missing void in the digital health ecosystem. Is this something you've thought about and consciously decided against because coordination costs are too high? Or do you plan on eventually focusing more on partnerships to limit your own resource expenditure to what doesn't exist elsewhere and what you can be the best in the world at?
