# Relative Nutritional Deficiency

Relative Nutritional Deficiency (RND) occurs when specific nutrients which work together to perform a function are individually within the normal range, but are abnormally high or low in relation to one another.

> Two primary categories of nutritional deficiency exist:
> 
> **Absolute Nutritional Deficiency** - Insufficient dietary nutrient intake causes absolute nutritional deficiencies. An absolute nutritional deficiency can be corrected by optimizing nutrient intake in the diet. Management of the problem is often enhanced by the administration of nutritional supplements, but they are not required.
> 
> **Relative Nutritional Deficiency (RND) -** Specific nutrients which work together to perform a function are individually within the normal range but are abnormally high or low in relation to one another. One example of this is seen with sodium to potassium ratio's.  Excess potassium in relationship to sodium could cause dizzy spells or low [blood pressure](../reference-databases/blood-pressure.md) and is too be avoided While lowering sodium intake is seen as desirable as high sodium is strongly associated with high blood pressure. The balance point between each nutrient is specific for correct function.
> 
> The monoamine-associated RND is by far the most prevalent constellation of nutritional deficiencies found in humans. It is postulated that over 80% of humans suffer from symptoms relating to a serotonin and/or catecholamine RND. Conditions prior to in situ [monoamine transporter optimization](./monoamine-transporter-optimization.md) (MTO, referred to in some previous papers as OCT functional status optimization) made it impossible to achieve consistent results with the administration of monoamine amino acid precursors. With the invention and refinement of MTO, the ability to study, manipulate, and optimally manage monoamine-related RND became clinically possible.

> The following ranges were extracted from a database containing over 2.4 million patient-days of amino acid management experience where monoamine-related RND were optimized with MTO. The effective therapeutic range was defined as the amino acid dosing values, within two standard deviations of the mean, that were associated with serotonin or dopamine in the phase 3 optimal range. Excluded from the data were patients suffering severe postsynaptic dopamine injury, such as Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome.
> 
> The daily effective therapeutic range of 5-HTP as evidenced by a phase 3 serotonin in the 80 to 240/g creatinine range was found to be >0 mg to 2400 mg.
> 
> The daily L-dopa effective therapeutic range as evidenced by phase 3 dopamine in the 475 to 1100/g creatinine range was found to be >0 mg to 2100 mg.
> 
> The daily effective therapeutic range of [L-tyrosine](./l-tyrosine.md) as evidenced by dopamine response to L-dopa administration was found to be >0 mg to 14,000 mg.
> 
> The dosing values of 5-HTP, L-dopa, and L-tyrosine are independent of each other. Some variability in the high-end range values may occur when individual RND-associated disease states are examined versus this entire group of diseases. Using L-tyrosine as an example, dosing values of 14,000 mg per day were unknown in the literature prior to this research. However, when amino acid dosing values are established with MTO, these seemingly high doses are uniformly well tolerated by patients, because electrical flow and the system revert back to normal.

## Protocol

The protocol for the treatment of depression consisted of the amino acid dosing values found in Table 1. This protocol was covered in previous peer-reviewed literature.2

Subjects also received the following daily dosing values of cofactors: 1) 1000 mg vitamin C, 2) 220 mg calcium citrate, 3) 75 mg vitamin B6, and 4) 400 mg folate.

> It takes up to 5 days for the maximum benefit of an amino acid dosing change to be seen.
> 
> As neurotransmitter levels increase with amino acid precursor administration, drug side effects may occur in ~5% of patients.
> 
> L-dopa and l-tyrosine have an ability to deplete sulfur amino acids. Based on previous experience and peer-reviewed literature, l-cysteine was added to the serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursors in the amounts of 4500 mg/day in adults in divided doses. Selenium 400 mcg/day was administered with the l-cysteine to address concerns raised in the literature regarding l-cysteine facilitating neurotoxic insult by methylmercury. Other literature notes that selenium irreversibly binds to methylmercury rendering it nontoxic.

## L-tyrosine and [MAOI](../reference-databases/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois.md) Safety

> With 55 years of prescribing experience, there are no reported cases in the formal scientific literature of L-tyrosine administration with a MAO inhibitor inducing hypertensive crisis.
