# Glyphosate

Glyphosate is a herbicide. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen specific crops. Glyphosate was first registered for use in the U.S. in 1974.

## Dietary Consumption

According to the National Pesticide Information Center fact sheet, glyphosate is not included in compounds tested for by the Food and Drug Administration's Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, nor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. The U.S. has determined the acceptable daily intake of glyphosate at 1.75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) while the European Union has set it at 0.5.

Pesticide residue controls carried out by the EU Member States in 2016 analyzed 6,761 samples of food products for glyphosate residues. 3.6% of the samples contained quantifiable glyphosate residue levels with 19 samples (0.28%) exceeding the European maximum residue levels (MRLs), which included six samples of honey and other apicultural products (MRL = 0.05 mg/kg) and eleven samples of buckwheat and other pseudocereals (MRL = 0.1 mg/kg).

Glyphosate residues below the European MRLs were most frequently found in:

-   Dry lentils
-   Linseeds
-   Soy beans
-   Dry peas
-   Tea
-   Buckwheat
-   Barley
-   Wheat
-   Rye

In Canada, a survey of 7,955 samples of food found that 42.3 % contained detectable quantities of glyphosate and only 0.6 % contained a level higher than the Canadian MRL of 0.1 mg/kg for most foods and 4 mg/kg for beans and chickpeas.

### Organic Products

Of the products that exceeded maximum residue levels (MRLs), one-third were organic products.

## Questions

1.  Is the incidence of glyphosate-related disease lower in the countries where it's been banned?
2.  How many milligrams of glyphosate are consumed by the average person in each country?
