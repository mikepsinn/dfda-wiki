# Utilitropic

Utilitropics are hypothetical futuristic utopian nootropic 'designer drugs' that can enhance mood safely while preserving or even enhancing intelligence. Psychoactive substance stacks may one day be made to boost the range of benefits and reduce side effects and prevent glutamate excitotoxicity when they leave the prototype stage. Future intellectually designed utilitropic drugs could far rival our wildest dreams and have an extremely high safety range.

## Examples

Examples of utilitropics are:

-   Modafinil")
-   phenylpiracetam")
-   Seroquel")
-   Selegiline")
-   PF-4455242")
-   NSI-189")
-   5-API")
-   9-Methyl-Beta-Carboline")
-   JWH-200")
-   CGS-15943")
-   5-MAPB")
-   Selank")
-   [bromantane](../interventions/bromantane.md)
-   methiopropamine")
-   kratom")
-   [parnate](../interventions/parnate.md)
-   memantine

Examples of near utilitropic stacks are:

-   The [amphetamine and memantine stack](../interventions/memantine.md)").
-   The [MDMA and memantine stack](../interventions/memantine.md)").
-   The [JWH-200 and memantine stack](../interventions/memantine.md)").
-   The [methiopropamine, memantine, flopropione, and Selegiline stack](../interventions/memantine.md)").
-   The modafinil and Selegiline stack").
-   The [Parnate, memantine, opicapone, and kratom stack](../interventions/parnate.md)").
-   The [methiopropamine, phenylpiracetam, and memantine stack](../interventions/memantine.md)").

## Benefits

Future functional equivalents of current substances may be made in the future with a far greater range of benefits and far fewer side effects. Already, we are seeing modafinil as a superior alternative to caffeine. We are seeing bretazenil and 2-methyl-2-butanol being used as superior alternatives to ethanol with less toxicity and side effects. We may see future substances and substance combinations with much greater boost in both intelligence and mood and with dramatically reduced side effects. The future substances could be non-toxic and have no long-term dangers. We must not prematurely foreclose such opportunities to radically boost intelligence and positive mood range towards superintelligence and superhappiness.
