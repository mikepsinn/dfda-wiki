# Differentiation Between a Supplement and a Drug

[Glyphosate](./glyphosate.md) was patented as an antibiotic. EPA testing has shown that we currently consume it every day as residues on our food. Yet, the FDA permits selling products containing glyphosate without any clinical trials. There's also no labeling requirement to even inform people that it's in the food they're buying.

However, the FDA just said N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a nutritional supplement that's been sold over the counter for decades, is now considered a drug. Amazon just had to remove it despite decades of research showing it to be safe and effective. NAC is too old to be patentable. Therefore, it would be very difficult for a drug company to ever recover the >$100 million required to get it through the FDA approval process.

Is there a flow chart or decision tree that they use to determine that:

1.  N-acetyl-cysteine is a regulated drug
2.  Glyphosate is an unregulated chemical
3.  CoQ10 is a nutritional supplement and not a drug

Or is it just based on the arbitrary opinions of whoever's currently working at the FDA?

Please complete this wiki by explaining the FDA process for determining if a specific chemical or compound is a drug that should be illegal until going through the regulatory process.
