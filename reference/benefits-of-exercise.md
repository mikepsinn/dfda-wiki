# Benefits of Exercise

Daniel Lieberman, author of [Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding](https://www.amazon.com/Exercised-Something-Evolved-Healthy-Rewarding/dp/1524746983), says the majority of the health problems we attribute to aging these days are not the direct consequence of more birthdays. They're due to modern behaviors and lifestyles. He calls them "mismatch diseases" -- the result of a mismatch between how we were designed to live vs how we actually do.

## Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 Diabetes is virtually unheard of in hunter-gatherers. But it's now the fastest growing disease in the modern world, increasing more than sevenfold between 1975 and 2005. Exercise reverses insulin resistance.

## Heart Attacks

Before World War 2 heart attacks weren't nearly as big an issue. Medical science barely even felt the need to study them. In 1946, researcher Jeremy Morris said you could go to the Royal Society of Medicine library and read all the literature on heart attacks before it was time for tea. But now cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. How do you prevent heart attacks? Take a guess.

From Exercised:

> _One massive study of nearly ten thousand men found that individuals with good cardiorespiratory fitness had more than a fourfold lower risk for cardiovascular diseases than those with poor fitness, and those who improved their fitness cut their risk in half._

## Cancer

An Italian study showed that between 1760 and 1839 less than one percent of people died from cancer. Now it's one of the most common killers. Again, we can attribute a big part of its increase to lack of exercise.

From Exercised:

> _When the researchers looked at the relationship between varying physical activity levels and cancer rates (controlling for sex, age, smoking, alcohol, and education), they found a clear dose-response relationship. Compared with those who were sedentary, modest exercisers had 13 to 20 percent lower cancer rates, and those who exercised moderately or more had 25 to 30 percent lower cancer rates._

## Alzheimer's

It's twenty times more common in the West than in the developing world and is projected to increase fourfold by 2050. There is no cure and no effective treatments except one.

From Exercised:

> _Exercise is by far the most effective known form of prevention and treatment. Further, the effects are impressive. An analysis of sixteen prospective studies including more than 160,000 individuals found that moderate levels of physical activity lowered the risk of Alzheimer's by 45 percent._

## The Problem Is Not Just Too Much Sitting

So there's hope. We just have to get moving. But very recently the emphasis hasn't been on that. A lot of what we've been hearing has largely been asking, _"Isn't the problem just too much sitting?"_

We've all read the scary headlines about the dangers of too much sitting. But guess what? Those healthy hunter-gatherers sit a lot, too.

From Exercised:

> _The Hadza, for example, spend about nine 'non-ambulatory' hours on a typical day, mostly sitting on the ground with their legs in front of them, but also squatting about two hours a day and kneeling an hour a day. So while nonindustrial people engage in considerably more physical activity than average industrialized and post-industrialized people, they also sit a lot._

And other research shows that marathon runners sit as much as less athletic people. So what's the deal?

Sitting, by itself, is not going to kill you. The problems here are caused by weight gain, chronic low-grade inflammation, and too much sugar and fat floating around in your bloodstream.

And sitting at the office is not the problem. It is uninterrupted hours of sitting _at home_ that are the real culprit.

From Exercised:

> _One massive fifteen-year-long study of more than ten thousand Danes found no association between time spent sitting at work and heart disease. An even bigger study on sixty-six thousand middle-aged Japanese office workers yielded similar results. Instead, leisure-time sitting best predicts mortality, suggesting that socioeconomic status and exercise habits in mornings, evenings, and weekends have important health effects beyond how much one sits during weekdays at the office._

So what's the answer? Regular exercise combined with occasionally getting up from the couch. From Exercised:

> _A multiyear analysis of almost five thousand Americans found that people who broke up their sitting time with frequent short breaks had up to 25 percent less inflammation than those who rarely rose from their chairs despite sitting the same number of hours._

## How Much? What Type?

Studies show there is no standard "U-shaped curve" when it comes to exercise. In the vast majority of cases, more is better, albeit with diminishing returns past a certain point. Plain and simple, the negatives from too little far outweigh the problems from too much.

From Exercised:

> _As you can see, the biggest reduction in mortality, about a 30 percent drop, is between sedentary individuals and those who exercise sixty minutes a week. However, the risk of death continues to fall with higher doses of exercise. People who report three and six weekly hours of exercise lower their risk of death by about another 10 percent and 15 percent, respectively._

People who don't want to go to the gym act like figuring out the proper workout plan is a mystery on par with dark matter. Truth is, this is one area where there's a clear answer that nearly all the studies agree on. From Exercised:

> _...engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week and weight train at least twice a week. Epidemiologists have calculated that this level of activity will reduce my risk of dying prematurely by 50 percent and lower my chances of getting heart disease, Alzheimer's, and certain cancers by roughly 30 to 50 percent._

So what's a clear, simple way to get started given our natural disinclination towards moving for no reason?

Well, that 10,000 steps-a-day stuff you've probably heard about actually jives with the science. It's also no coincidence that hunter-gatherer women walk about 5 miles a day -- which works out to about 10,000 steps. Get a pedometer and make it a game to hit that number.

George Sheehan once said, “Exercise is done against one's wishes and maintained only because the alternative is worse.” We now know what to do... but how do we get ourselves to do it when it doesn't come naturally?

## Sum Up

-   **Exercise is not natural. Neither is being sedentary.** We did not evolve to move for no reason, but we have been excellent at eliminating reasons. Not moving turns twenty-year-olds into forty-year-olds faster than... well, a lot faster than twenty years.
-   **Mismatch Diseases:** Many of the illnesses we attribute to age are not due to age. Live like someone lying in a hospital bed, and you will soon be someone lying in a hospital bed.
-   **Sitting, by itself, is not the problem**
-   **How much? What kind?:** At least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week, and weight train at least twice a week.
-   **Motivation:** Create a good reason and socialize. Find something you enjoy doing or that you can attach an immediate reward to. Involve friends to add the lovely component of socializing (and for strategic guilt purposes).
