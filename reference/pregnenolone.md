# Pregnenolone

Pregnenolone is a steroid hormone that plays a key role in the production of other steroid hormones, including progesterone, DHEA, and estrogen. The substance is found naturally in the body, but some people also take it in supplement form to help keep memory sharp through the years.

## Administration

### What Time of Day Should I Take Pregnenolone?

Ideally, you would take it first thing in the morning with breakfast, since taking Pregnenolone later in the day can lead to insomnia.
