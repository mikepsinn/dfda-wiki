# Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

HRV is a measure of the variation in time between each heartbeat.

# Autonomic Nervous System

This variation is controlled by a primitive part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It works regardless of our desire and regulates, among other things, our heart rate, [blood pressure](./blood-pressure.md), breathing, and digestion. 

The ANS is subdivided into two large components, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the fight-or-flight mechanism and the relaxation response.
