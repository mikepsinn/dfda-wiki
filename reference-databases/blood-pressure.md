# Blood Pressure

When your heart beats, it squeezes and pushes blood through your arteries to the rest of your body. This force creates pressure on those blood vessels, and that's your systolic blood pressure.

# Systolic vs Diastolic

Over time, newer research revealed systolic pressure ”the top number” as a better predictor of heart concerns. That's why, by the early 2000s, the pendulum had swung to a 'near-exclusive' focus on systolic high blood pressure, according to a study in the July 2019 issue of _The New England Journal of Medicine_.
