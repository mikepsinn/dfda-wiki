# MAO-A

[Monoamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monoamine) oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a FAD-dependent [mitochondrial enzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/mitochondrial-enzyme), which, together with its [isoenzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/isoenzyme) MAO-B, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of structurally diverse amines Cesura and Pletscher (1992), Kalgutkar et al. (2001). MAO-A is mainly involved in the metabolism of [monoamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/neurotransmitter), such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Although there is no clear distinction between MAO-A and MAO-B selective substrates, evidence indicates that [norepinephrine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/noradrenalin) and 5-hydroxytryptamine are mainly substrates for MAO-A, with dopamine being deaminated by both isoforms, likely in a region-specific manner. The [sympathomimetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/adrenergic-receptor-stimulating-agent) amine [tyramine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tyramine) shows similar Km values for MAO-A and MAO-B, but appears to be mainly metabolized by MAO-A in the gastrointestinal tract Hasan et al. (1988) and in sympathetic noradrenergic neurons.

Inhibitors of MAO-A are in clinical use for affective disorders. On a historical note, the serendipitous finding that the tubercolostatic agent [iproniazide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/iproniazid) had antidepressant properties and inhibited MAO paved the way for modern pharmacopsychiatry. Iproniazide can be considered the first antidepressant introduced into clinical practice, Pletscher (1991).
