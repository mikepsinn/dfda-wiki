# MAO-B

[Monoamine oxidase-B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/amine-oxidase-flavin-containing-isoenzyme-b) (MAO-B) is a FAD-dependent [mitochondrial enzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/mitochondrial-enzyme), which, together with its [isoenzyme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/isoenzyme) MAO-A, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of structurally diverse amines Kalgutkar et al. (2001). MAO-B is involved in the metabolism of [biogenic amines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/biogenic-amine) as well as amine [xenobiotics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/xenobiotic-agent) Cesura and Pletscher (1992). Substrates preferential for MAO-B include [2-phenylethylamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/phenethylamine) and [benzylamine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/benzylamine). Other substrates, e.g., dopamine and [tyramine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tyramine), show similar Km values for MAO-B and MAO-A Tipton et al. (1987), Waldmeier (1987). Among the xenobiotic amines metabolized by MAO-B, the [dopaminergic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/dopamine-receptor-stimulating-agent) [neurotoxin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/neurotoxin) [1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/1-2-3-6-tetrahydro-1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine) (MPTP) has received particular attention due to its properties to induce a syndrome closely resembling Parkinson's disease. In fact, MAO-B plays a major role in the transformation of [MPTP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/1-2-3-6-tetrahydro-1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine) into [1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) (MPP+), the species responsible for the neurotoxic effects Langston et al. (1983), Markey et al. (1984).

The [MAO-B inhibitor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monoamine-oxidase-b-inhibitor) L-deprenyl is in clinical use for the treatment of [Parkinson's disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/parkinson-disease) and, currently, several MAO-B inhibitors are under clinical investigation in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
