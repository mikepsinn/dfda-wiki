# IC50

The **half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)** is a measure of the potency of a substance in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function.

IC50 is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance (e.g. drug) is needed to inhibit, _in vitro_, a given biological process or biological component by 50%. The biological component could be an enzyme, cell, cell receptor, or microorganism. IC50 values are typically expressed as molar concentration.

The IC50 value is inversely proportional to its strength. The higher the IC50 value, the smaller the strength of the drug, and vice versa.
