# Microbiome Optimization Initiative

There is likely no other area of medical research with more potential for reducing the suffering of chronic disease than the billions of tiny passengers inside our guts.

There is increasing evidence showing that the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota can alter brain physiology and behavior. Cognition was originally thought to be regulated only by the central nervous system. However, it is now clear that the gut-resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, regulate and influence cognitive dysfunction as well as the process of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular diseases.

Controllable factors such as diet can have a massive effect on the composition of the microbiota, for good or ill. Microbes release molecules that trigger inflammation throughout the central nervous system.

Many recent studies have shown that neuroinflammation contributes greatly to the development of neurological disorders such as:

-   Pain
-   Depression
-   Anxiety
-   Autism
-   Alzheimer's diseases
-   Parkinson's disease
-   Stroke

The most critical mechanisms of action in the development of downstream neurological dysfunction include:

-   Change of blood-brain barrier permeability, allowing harmful bacteria and proteins to enter and damage the brain
-   Brain vascular physiology
-   Brain structure

-   The following table illustrates the results of recent rodent studies and the effects of the presence or absence of strains of bacteria in the gut.

Animal 

Model type 

Phenotype and effect (vs. controls) 

NMRI mice 

Germ-free 

Increased motor activity and reduced anxiety

Wistar rat 

Application of probiotics:

_Lactobacillus helveticus_ R0052 and _Bifidobacterium longum_ R0175

Decreased stress-induced gastrointestinal discomfort and anxiolytic effect

Balb/c mice 

Application of probiotics:

_Lactobacillus rhamnosus_ (JB-1)

Increase of corticosterone, GABA receptor, _N_\-acetyl aspartate, and glutamate; reduced stress-induced corticosterone and anxiety- and depression-related behavior

Balb/c mice 

Germ-free, SPF and _B. infantis_ mice 

GF mice exhibited exaggerated HPA stress response and decreased BDNF compared to SPF mice, but can be reversed with _B. infantis_

Swiss Webster mice 

Germ-free 

GF mice have an anxiolytic behavior, increased BDNF, and reduced serotonin 1A receptor in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus

Balb/c mice and AKH mice 

_T. muris_ infection and application of probiotics _B. longum_ NCC3001 

Infection with _T. muris_ induced anxiety-like behavior and decreased level of BNDF. Treatment with _B. longum_ reverses the effect and normalizes BDNF level

Balb/c mice and NIH mice 

Germ-free and SPF with antibiotics 

Increased exploratory behavior and hippocampal expression of BDNF in the hippocampus

Stress-sensitive F344 Rat 

Germ-free and SPF 

Decreased social interaction in GF mice

Swiss Webster mice 

Germ-free 

Significant social impairments and decreased social preference in GF mice

Wistar rat 

Application of antibiotic 

Reduced social interactions in offspring when antibiotic is applied peri-conceptionally

Swiss Webster mice 

Germ-free 

Increased exploratory in GF mice

Swiss Webster mice 

Application of antibiotic 

Increased exploratory behavior in antibiotic-treated mice

C57BL/6 mice 

Application of antibiotic 

Decreased working memory in antibiotic-treated SPF mice; no effect on spatial memory

Swiss Webster mice 

Germ-free 

Decreased working memory in GF mice

C57BL/6 mice 

SPF 

Decreased working memory in antibiotic-treated SPF mice

C57BL/6 mice and CF1 mice 

_Citrobacter rodentidum_ infection 

Increase anxiety and memory dysfunction

The goal of the FEDMI Microbiome Optimization Initiative is to extend this research by promoting the collection and analysis of:

1.  microbiome samples
2.  data on the severity and incidence of various chronic illnesses for those donors

Once this data is available, it can be used to determine the optimal ratios of various strains of bacteria to alleviate specific diseases.

At this time, the focus will be directed at quantifying the effectiveness of various techniques for adjusting the ratio of various species, including:

1.  Prebiotic and probiotic supplementation
2.  Dietary modifications
3.  Fecal microbiota transplantation
