# Nonprofit Fiscal Sponsors

A _fiscal sponsor_ is a tax-exempt organization that agrees to receive funds and conduct other administrative functions on your group's behalf.

## Fees

Most charge 5%-10%

Almost every fiscal sponsor says it charges a percentage of project revenues (96%), and, of those, 71% are in the 5%-10% range. Also, of those with sliding-scale fees, usually depending on a project's revenues, about a third range from 5% to 10%. Seventy sponsors will charge up to 15% or more, usually to handle government-funded projects, which can require adhering to higher federal audit standards. What mostly accounts for the fee disparity is the range of services a sponsor provides.

All projects incur a $2,500 start-up fee, depending on the need and urgency to start your Project. We charge a monthly flat-rate fee that starts at $2,500 per month for fee-based projects. For percentage-based projects (that are uncertain of their revenue e.g., a one-time fundraising event or campaign for example), we charge a fee between 5% - 15% of funds raised.  For government grants in which we prepare the response to the RFP and provide management of the project, we charge a flat fee that starts at $3,500 per month, plus an additional fee for services we provide as required and allowable by the grant awardee.
