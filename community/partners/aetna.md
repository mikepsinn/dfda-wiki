Aetna's Interoperability API Developer Portal

The Aetna Interoperability API Developer Portal provides third-party app developers with access to documentation, registration services, Developer Sandbox services, and other developer services related to application programming interfaces ('APIs') provided by Aetna or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including Allina Health | Aetna and Innovation Health, pursuant to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ('CMS') Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule (CMS-9115-F).

Once services are live:

-   The Patient Access API will allow developers to retrieve, with the approval and at the direction of an applicable Aetna enrolled or the enrolled's personal representative, certain data, as applicable, concerning adjudicated claims, encounter data from capitated providers, formulary data, and certain clinical data, if Aetna maintains any such data.
-   The Provider Directory API will allow developers to retrieve, as applicable, certain Aetna provider and pharmacy directory information.
-   The Developer Sandbox will allow developers to test their application's connection to the APIs without establishing production access to the APIs.
