VitaDAO is an open cooperative that anyone can join, with the goal to acquire, support, and finance new therapeutics and research data in the longevity space. The VitaDAO collective will directly hold legal IP rights to these projects and may develop a growing portfolio of assets represented as NFTs.

## The VitaDAO Ecosystem

Members of the public can join VitaDAO and become owners of its IP by purchasing VITA tokens through contributing funds, work, or valuable research data or IP assets. Ownership and governance of VitaDAO require VITA tokens. VITA tokens enable their holder to engage in decision-making and governance of VitaDAO’s research, signal support for specific initiatives, and govern its data repositories and IP portfolio.

# Vision

VitaDAO will acquire and commission research, as well as own, develop and monetize the resulting intellectual property assets. VitaDAO's portfolio consists of:  
  
1\. NFTs represent the intellectual property, patents, and licenses of therapeutic research projects.  
  
2\. Data assets generated by funding R&D around its research projects and NFTs.  
  
Vetted longevity research projects will request funds from VitaDAO, and members will vote to grant or raise those funds in exchange for ownership of the resulting IP.

## DAO Economics

To fund more research and to provide long-term funding for the DAO operations, there are several options to monetize owned data and IP. VitaDAO can enter co-development deals with private companies or other DAOs. 

In single or multi-license agreements, VitaDAO could license data and IP to 3rd parties or could sell to the highest suitable bidder. Ocean Data Market, as a partner, offers the means to securely sell or license data and IP

# Ocean Data-Market

One route of IP monetization will be the Ocean Market, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for data, where VitaDAO can securely publish selected parts of the research data/findings. This data has automatic price discovery and is published as an interoperable ERC20 data token. Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” even allows private data to be bought & sold while preserving control and privacy of the data.
