## Contraindications

Ketamine is contra-indicated in persons in whom an elevation of [blood pressure](../reference-databases/blood-pressure.md) would constitute a serious hazard.

Ketamine should not be used in patients with eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, severe coronary or myocardial disease, cerebrovascular accident, or cerebral trauma.

## Routes of Administration

Route of administration 

Starting dose 

For Average Human Weight of 62 **kg (137lbs)** 

Intravenous 

0.25-2 mg/kg 

15 mg-124 mg 

[Intraosseous](../reference/intraosseous.md) 

0.5-2 mg/kg 

31 mg-124 mg 

Intramuscular 

4-10 mg/kg 

240 mg-620 mg 

By mouth 

3-15 mg/kg 

180 mg-900 mg 

Intranasal 

0.25-9 mg/kg 

15 mg-360 mg 

### Subcutaneous

2 mg/kg ketamine administered subcutaneously versus 1 mg/kg iv 15 min before surgery [provided better pain control](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4933765/) for 24 hours.

### Nasal

#### Bioavailability

It is reported that the bioavailability of nasally administered ketamine in children was approximately 50%.

### Intramuscular

The bioavailability of intramuscularly administered ketamine is approximate 93%.

#### Sites

The primary sites used for intramuscular (IM) injections are the gluteal (buttocks), deltoid (upper arm), and vastus lateralis (lateral thigh) muscles.

#### Complications

Potential complications include infections and nerve damage. The latter usually results from the choice of an incorrect site for injection.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Rapid absorption in many cases, often in under 30 min.

Although, the time to peak drug concentration is often on the order of 1 or 2 hours.

The rate of drug absorption and the peak drug levels obtained will often differ between sites used for IM injections. This is related to differences in blood flow among muscle groups. The site was chosen for an IM injection in humans, and some animals may be a critical factor in whether the drug exhibits an effect (Schwartz _et al.,_ 1974).

#### Dosage

Intramuscular administration of ketamine in a dose range from 25 to 200 mg has been reported to produce psychotropic effects in humans.

## Quantitative Composition

Every 1 ml of solution typically contains Ketamine hydrochloride, equivalent to 50 mg ketamine base per ml.

## Solubility

200 mg per mL of H2O

## Melting Point

92.5ºC

## Tolerance

![](https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/img/300px-Ketamine_Tolerance.png)

Ketamine tolerance has been proven to exist in rats and monkeys.  Tolerance evolves rapidly in both species (figure below).  Among rats, cross-tolerance exists between ketamine and fentanyl (but not morphine).  This raises the possibility that cross-tolerance in humans could exist between ketamine and some synthetic opioids. [https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/ketamine-tolerance/](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/ketamine-tolerance/)

Tolerance to the main effects of ketamine develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects.

After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

Ketamine presents cross-tolerance with all dissociatives, meaning that after the consumption of ketamine all dissociatives will have a reduced effect.

### Permatolerance

Dissociatives are reported to be unique from other substances because they produce a long-term or permanent form of tolerance ("permatolerance") that accrues slowly and independently of normal tolerance. Many long-term or heavy ketamine users report that they need to take substantially more to achieve dissociation or k-hole compared to their first use, even after taking extended breaks. It is unknown why or how this occurs, although it has been suggested to be a potential indicator of some form of neurotoxicity.

## Interactions

-   **Amphetamines** - No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase [blood pressure](../reference-databases/blood-pressure.md), but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around in high doses of this combination may be ill-advised due to the risk of physical injury.
-   **Cocaine** - No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase [blood pressure](../reference-databases/blood-pressure.md), but not an issue with sensible doses. Moving around in high doses of this combination may be ill-advised due to the risk of physical injury.
-   **Benzodiazepines** - Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position.
-   [**MAOIs**](../reference-databases/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois.md) - [MAO-B](../reference-databases/mao-b.md) inhibitors appear to increase the potency of ketamine. [MAO-A](../reference-databases/mao-a.md) inhibitors have some negative reports associated with the combination, but there isn't much information available
-   **Alcohol** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a very high risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
-   **GHB** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
-   **GBL** - Both substances cause ataxia and bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
-   **Opioids** - Both substances bring a risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position.
-   **Grapefruit** - Grapefruit juice significantly increases oral absorption of ketamine. This may result in the user having double the concentration of ketamine in their system compared to normal. The ketamine may also have a longer duration of effect. This is likely to apply to oral, sublingual, and intranasal administration.
