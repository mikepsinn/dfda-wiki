# Tolerance Prevention

### Before

[Magnesium Glycinate](http://www.iherb.com/Doctor-s-Best-Magnesium-High-Absorption-100-Chelated-120-Tablets/15?rcode=xon237) 1x200mg Pill (2,000mg magnesium glycinate, which is equivalent to 200mg elemental Mg)

[R-ALA](http://www.iherb.com/doctor-s-best-best-stabilized-r-lipoic-acid-100-mg-60-veggie-caps/4?rcode=xon237) 1x100mg (Reduces neurotoxicity)

[ALCAR](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QSLINE/) 1x500mg (Reduces neurotoxicity) 

[L-Theanine](http://www.iherb.com/now-foods-l-theanine-double-strength-200-mg-60-vcaps/6916?rcode=xon237) 1x200mg (Helps prevent tolerance buildup, however more for reduction of anxiety/paranoia/irritability)

[CoQ10](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0019GW3G8/) 1x100mg ("_Extremely long half life antioxidant, various beneficial effects on mitochondrial function_")

1-2x Tums, or 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a glass of water (Potentiates Adderall due to reduction in stomach acidity)

### During

Sugary snacks. Aim to eat one every ~30 minutes. (Helps maintain blood glucose levels - you'll feel less tired and happier)

Seriously - EAT AND DRINK!

Optionally: Dose one of each magnesium, R-ALA and ALCAR during.

### After

**To help you: Go to sleep easier and feel better tomorrow.**

[Melatonin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0019LTGC2/)

: 5-10mg a few hours before bed (Keep in mind, we are using a higher dose here for its antioxidant properties. Normal dosages should be .5mg to 1mg.)

If you are on a significant Adderall spree, consider replacing a re-dose of Adderall with Caffeine.
