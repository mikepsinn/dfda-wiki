# Bromantane

Bromantane — also known as Ladasten or NP-160 — is a nootropic drug that is a synthetic adaptogen (actoprotector) that shows in the improvement of mental and physical performance throughout the body by helping the brain increase and regulate neurotransmitters. It's classified as a mild stimulant and can help with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

## Cost

Bromantane isn't all that expensive, really. At 50 mg daily, you can get a 40-day supply for $18 or 100 days for $35.

## Dosage

> When it comes to new drugs that you aren’t used to, take it slow and see how you react to them under different conditions. Most Bromantane capsules come in amounts of 25 milligrams (mg), so start with one per day for a while to determine how you respond to it.
> 
> If you bought the powder form, start with an amount of 25 mg as well.

## Routes of Administration

> I've tried bromantane intranasally and sublingually; sublingually seemed the best because the powder doesn't like to absorb in the nasal passages without a lubricant. Both methods far outstrip oral administration: the onset is way faster, but the duration of effect is by no means reduced.

### Insufflation

> The effects are more pronounced and I find this ROA to be so much more convenient. Also, since the powder is non caustic and tasteless it's one of the best chemicals to insufflate IMO.

## Sleep

Bromantane was also noted to normalize the sleep-wake cycle. The authors concluded that "\[Bromantane\] in daily dose from 50 to 100 mg is a highly effective, well-tolerated and \[safe\] drug with a wide spectrum of clinical effects.

> You want to be relaxed before heading to sleep, and Bromantane (also known as ADK-709) can interfere with that goal according to our analysis. [https://wholisticresearch.com/bromantane/](https://wholisticresearch.com/bromantane/)

## Mechanism of Action

> Originally, bromantane was thought to act as a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and dopamine.\[4\]\[25\]\[34\] Indeed, bromantane does inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and to a lesser extent norepinephrine in vitro in rat brain tissue.\[25\]\[34\] However, the concentrations required to do so are extremely high (50–500 µM) and likely not clinically relevant.\[25\]\[34\] (Although one study found an [IC50](../reference-databases/ic50.md) for dopamine transport of 3.56 µM, relative to 28.66 nM for mesocarb; neither drug affected serotonin transport at the tested concentrations, in contrast.)\[30\] In any case, the lack of typical psychostimulant-like effects and adverse effects seen with bromantane supports the notion that it is not acting significantly as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor, but rather via enhancement of dopamine synthesis.
